## Description

Super Rinkeby Alpha is a fully decentralized game on IPFS. The game is built with Unity, exported to webgl and hosted on IPFS. The game can be played without signing in with stock characters or can be played with NFTs purchased on Rarible marketplace as ERC-1155 tokens and EthBlockArt as ERC721 tokens. To access the NFTs, users must sign a message proving that they own the account. This message is valid for 5 minutes. This novel approach does not require a centralized database nor importing private keys. The user has full control of their funds. No custodial wallet. Enjoy!
